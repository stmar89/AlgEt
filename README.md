# AlgEt
A package for Magma to make computation with Ã©tale algebras.
The goal is to make the Ideal Class Monoid algorithm available.

This will be built using direct product of number fields as core, for superior speed.

TODO:
- an AlgEtToAlgAss intrinsic which returns an AlgAss and an isomorphism.
- saving and printing
